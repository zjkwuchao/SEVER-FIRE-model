# SEVER-FIRE-model
This is the official release of the (Socio-Economic and natural Vegetation ExpeRimental global fire model) SEVER-FIRE, version 1.0. 

SEVER-FIRE is a quasi-mechanistic model, which is a follow up of Reg-FIRM (Venevsky et al., 2002) for the globe, with several new features aiming approaching to complete representation of wildfire processes. We improve earlier algorithms of Reg-FIRM and introduce new functionality with respect: 1) to estimate the numbers of lightning fires from data on convective activity in the atmosphere 2) to estimate numbers of human fires from urban against rural population (timing of their appearance in natural landscapes and their ratio) and regional wealth index, as well 3) to estimate more realistically fire duration, which in the new model depends on human suppression and weather situation and can last for up to two days. The SEVER-FIRE module can be coupled into different DGVMs and ESMs.

The description of SEVER-FIRE (v1.0) is shown in the following publication:

SEVER-FIRE code is coordinated by Sergey Venevsky (venevsky@tsinghua.edu.cn) and Chao Wu (chaowu.thu@gmail.com). If you need further clarification of the data policy, please contact them.
